# f23-geo-calculator-hw3-start

You have two different options with regard to your starting point for homework #3.  These are documented in detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o4-V_1c73CLtF9TgnCzid8_8GdSUd8xzqwVtrYbCU8w/edit?usp=sharing).

Please note that regardless of what approach you take, the final default branch of the repo (currently set to 'main') must be where you submit your solution to be graded.  If you must change the default branch you may do so under the repository Settings >> Genmeral >> set default branch.
